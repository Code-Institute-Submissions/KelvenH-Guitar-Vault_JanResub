# OVERVIEW
The site offers a subscription service for guitarist. Members enjoy access to a range of guitars (electric, acoustic and bass). Tiered subscription plans provide access to higher value instruments as well as provision of additional services (including express delivery and full guitar set-up). Members receive a 'plectrum' in exchange for their subscription fee which is used to grab a :guitar: from the vault. 

Guitar Vault has been built using <img valign="middle" height="50" src="https://github.com/devicons/devicon/blob/master/icons/django/django-original.svg"/> a <img valign="middle" height="40" src="https://github.com/devicons/devicon/blob/master/icons/python/python-original-wordmark.svg"/> framework, and also employs <img valign="middle" height="40" src="https://github.com/devicons/devicon/blob/master/icons/html5/html5-plain-wordmark.svg"/> <img valign="middle" height="40" src="https://github.com/devicons/devicon/blob/master/icons/css3/css3-plain-wordmark.svg"/> <img valign="middle" height="30"  src="https://github.com/devicons/devicon/blob/master/icons/javascript/javascript-plain.svg"/> and <img valign="middle" height="35" src="https://github.com/devicons/devicon/blob/master/icons/jquery/jquery-plain-wordmark.svg"/>. The deployed site is hosted on <img valign="middle" height="40" src="https://github.com/devicons/devicon/blob/master/icons/heroku/heroku-original-wordmark.svg"/>, the static and media images are hosted in the :cloud:  with <img valign="middle" height="75" src="https://github.com/devicons/devicon/blob/master/icons/amazonwebservices/amazonwebservices-plain-wordmark.svg"/>, whilst payments are processed through <img valign="middle" src="https://github.com/KelvenH/Guitar-Vault/blob/main/README_FILES/cc-stripe.png"/>. A fully responsive site layout is handled through <img valign="middle" height="40" src="https://github.com/devicons/devicon/blob/master/icons/bootstrap/bootstrap-plain-wordmark.svg"/>.

Many guitarists suffer from G.A.S. (Gear Acquisition Syndrome) - a desire to accrue a range of guitars (as well as amps and pedals) to expand their tonal possibilities. There are many downsides to this, principally the bank balance battering and the need for space for all these instruments. And of course, you can only play 1 guitar at a time. Often the G.A.S. niggle is only temporarily quelled with a new purchase, before the urge for the next guitar takes over! This is where Guitar Vault comes in. Through this service, members get the chance to get their hands on a high end instrument and although these will only be in your possession for a month, the remedy comes from another guitar of your choosing to keep your playing rocking on and G.A.S. levels tuned down!

## SCOPE
The scope of this activity includes;
- provision of a site which satisfies user stories in being able to view, interact through the front-end.
- manage site content (guitars, categories, orders and subscription plans) through back-end technologies (in some cases through Admin).
- enable payments to be made and recorded.

Out of scope;
- additional activities which in a real business would be required, such as; scheduling of on-going monthly payments (only the initial payment is demonstrated), inventory management systems relating to the handling / scheduling of guitar loan bookings, delivery & collection processes, etc.

------
## STRUCTURE
*Please note; not all planned content was able to be completed in time. Some aspects of these feature in the user stories and in the planned wireframes, database schema. These are clearly indicated in the testing (against user stories) and within the planned future enhancements table.*

### FRONT END STRUCTURE & SCREEN FLOW

The structure of the site should provide a clean and clear interface for site users. Leveraging from django's app structure, there will be specific page content for each app module, yet a baseline html view will be applied consistently across all pages. Site navigation will primarily be through the navigation menu displayed in the header (and through an icon for small screen devices). The only exception to this will be the additional on-screen links (visually displayed as buttons) to proceed to the next / return to the last view (e.g. proceeding to the payment form.

An initial schematic of the front end screen screen flow (please note that there are some variations to the actual end design).

*insert workflow diagram here*

### DATABASE STRUCTURE
*Please note comments above re aspects not delivered in this build as well as some deviations from the original design*

This build will leverage django's SQLite database during development. Upon deployment this will migrate to POSTGRES (once hosted on HEROKU).

The diagram below outlines the core components of the database - the individual tables, their expected fields and relationships between them. Most tables will be structured within their own django app with some exceptions (e.g. guitars and categories will both be held in the same model).

In summary;
- Categories - classifies guitars (Electric, Bass or Acoustic)
- Guitars - houses all information relating to each guitar including the image ID
- Subscription Plans - contains the tier (Platinum, Gold, Silver and Bronze) their price and details of any additional features
- Member Profiles - users personal information (delivery address, contact details), active subscription plan and guitar rack* (past, current and 'favourited guitars) * *not implemented*
- Orders - information on subscription plans purchased through the site

### WIREFRAMES

Wireframes were developed in Adobe XD, png exports are attached below. Initial designs were produced for desktop view with the intention of columns being condensed (via Bootstrap responsive grid). An example mobile screen was produced for the home screen but not for the other html pages.

## SURFACE
### Influences
Inspiration for the site layout was taken from on-line music retailers. An example is shown below which has a bootstrap style responsive grid layout.

Example guitar retailer:

![retailer](https://github.com/KelvenH/Guitar-Vault/blob/main/README_FILES/ExampleRetailer.png)

The intention was to have a dark theme for the site, with simple visual styling with gold accents. The site logo took great influence from the 'serif' style logos of some of the greatest known guitar and amp brands (i.e. Marshall, Gibson and Fender). A font was found which paid homage to these world famous logos, yet remained extremely legible.

Inspiration for site logo:

![logos](https://github.com/KelvenH/Guitar-Vault/blob/main/README_FILES/Logos.png)

The site logo was achieved by applying the Google Font 'lobster' font-family over a textured 'rust' background which due to the zoom level actually provides a slight 'aged leather' look. A font mask* was then applied using another 'gold' texture image (both texture images were licensed from Adobe Stock). * *see acknowledgements for font-mask*
The layering was achieved in CSS using a combination of text-fill and background-clip with a back-up gold font (declared in the root variable as was the font-family). The CSS is shown here;


``` 
    .gold-special-txt {
        color:var(--off-gold); /*- backup font color if text mask fails -*/  
        background: url('/media/gold-texture.jpg');  
        background-size: cover;
        -webkit-text-fill-color: transparent;
        -webkit-background-clip: text;
        -moz-background-clip:text;
        background-clip:text;
        }
``` 

The final result achieved;

![site logo](https://github.com/KelvenH/Guitar-Vault/blob/main/README_FILES/Guitar-Vault_banner.png)

It was important to use a 'simple' sans-serif font elsehwere on the site, for which another Google Font was used 'Varta'.
