# OVERVIEW
The site offers a subscription service for guitarist. Members enjoy access to a range of guitars (electric, acoustic and bass). Tiered subscription plans provide access to higher value instruments as well as provision of additional services (incluing express delivery and full guitar set-up). Members receive a 'plectrum' in exchange for their subscription fee which is used to grab a :guitar: from the vault. 

Guitar Vault has been built using <img valign="middle" height="50" src="https://github.com/devicons/devicon/blob/master/icons/django/django-original.svg"/> a <img valign="middle" height="40" src="https://github.com/devicons/devicon/blob/master/icons/python/python-original-wordmark.svg"/> framework, and also employs <img valign="middle" height="40" src="https://github.com/devicons/devicon/blob/master/icons/html5/html5-plain-wordmark.svg"/> <img valign="middle" height="40" src="https://github.com/devicons/devicon/blob/master/icons/css3/css3-plain-wordmark.svg"/> <img valign="middle" height="30"  src="https://github.com/devicons/devicon/blob/master/icons/javascript/javascript-plain.svg"/> and <img valign="middle" height="35" src="https://github.com/devicons/devicon/blob/master/icons/jquery/jquery-plain-wordmark.svg"/>.

## SCOPE
The scope of this activity includes;
- provision of a site which satisfies user stories in being able to view, interact through the front-end.
- manage site content (guitars, categories, orders and subscription plans) through back-end technologies (in some cases through Admin).
- enable payments to be made and recorded.

Out of scope;
- additional activities which in a real business would be required, such as; handling of guitar loan requests, scheduling of on-going monthly payments (only the initial payment is demonstrated, inventory management systems such as scheduling of guitar bookings, delivery & collection processes, etc).

------
## STRUCTURE
*Please note; not all planned content was able to be completed in time. Some aspects of these feature in the user stories and in the planned wireframes, database schema. These are clearly indicated in the testing (against user stories) and within the planned future enhancements table.*

### FRONT END STRUCTURE & SCREEN FLOW

The structure of the site should provide a clean and clear interface for site users. Leveraging from django's app structure, there will be specific page content for each app module, yet a baseline html view will be applied consistently across all pages. Site navigation will primarily be through the navigation menu displayed in the header (and through an icon for small screen devices). The only exception to this will be the additional on-screen links (visually displayed as buttons) to proceed to the next / return to the last view (e.g. proceeding to the payment form.

An initial schematic of the front end screen screen flow (please note that there are some variations to the actual end design).

*insert workflow diagram here*

### DATABASE STRUCTURE
*Please note comments above re aspects not delivered in this build as well as some deviations from the original design*

This build will leverage django's SQLite databse during development. Upon deployment this will migrate to POSTGRES (once hosted on HEROKU).

The diagram below outlines the core components of the database - the individual tables, their expected fields and relationships between them. Most tables will be structured within their own django app with some exceptions (e.g. guitars and categories will both be held in the same model).

In summary;
- Categories - classifies guitars (Electric, Bass or Acoustic)
- Guitars - houses all information relating to each guitar including the image ID
- Subscription Plans - contains the tier (Platinum, Gold, Silver and Bronze) their price and details of any additional features
- Member Profiles - users personal information (delivery address, contact details), active subscription plan and guitar rack* (past, current and 'favourited guitars) * *not implemented*
- Orders - information on subscription plans purchased through the site
