# OVERVIEW
The site offers a subscription service for guitarist. Members enjoy access to a range of guitars (electric, acoustic and bass). Tiered subscription plans provide access to higher value instruments as well as provision of additional services (incluing express delivery and full guitar set-up). Members receive a 'plectrum' in exchange for their subscription fee which is used to grab a :guitar: from the vault.
